    "text": "1.1 Wireless Transmission\nIn wireless transmission, we usually want to transmit data via a transmitter (TX) and a connected antenna to a receiver (RX). This arrangement is shown in Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The block diagram of a simple wireless system.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, wireless transmission is hard. The wireless channel, i.e., the usage of electromagnetic waves to transmit information from a transmitter to a receiver, is hard. The wireless channel, while tremendously useful, unfortunately has quite a few undesired features:\n\nThe wireless channels is shared between all users.\nAs a consequence, the available bandwidth is shared; this means that bandwidth is a scarce resource.\nThe wireless channel has significant losses.\nThe channel is time variant, as usually the transmitter and/or the receiver move, and/or the environment changes.\n\nIn order to estimate the power \\(P_\\mathrm{R}\\) of the wireless transmission at the receiver we can use Friis’ transmission formula (Pozar 2011):\n\\[\nP_\\mathrm{R} = P_\\mathrm{T} \\cdot \\frac{A_\\mathrm{R} \\cdot A_\\mathrm{T}}{d^2 \\cdot \\lambda^2}\n\\tag{1}\\]\nHere, \\(A_\\mathrm{R}\\) and \\(A_\\mathrm{T}\\) are the effective areas of the transmit and the receive antenna, while \\(d\\) is the distance (line of sight) between the two antennas, and \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength of the used transmission frequency.\nThe effective area of an antenna depends on the type and construction, but generally we can say that\n\\[\nA \\propto \\lambda^2\n\\]\nFor an isotropic antenna (a theoretical construct where the radiation is equal in all directions) \\(A = \\lambda^2 / (4 \\pi)\\), while for a \\(\\lambda/2\\)-dipole \\(A = 0.13 \\lambda^2\\). Of course, the speed of light \\(c\\) relates frequency \\(f\\) and wavelength \\(\\lambda\\) of an electromagnetic wave by\n\\[\nc = \\lambda f.\n\\]\nGenerally speaking, the size of an electromagnetic antenna is proportional to the wavelength of the EM wave use for transmission. For man devices, we seek antenna on the order of a few centimeters, this is way frequencies in the hundreds of MHz to GHz are so popular. Table 1 lists a few typical applications and their frequency and wavelength.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Typical RF applications with their operating frequencies and corresponding wavelengths\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication\nFrequency\nWavelength\n\n\n\n\nFM Radio\n88–108 MHz\n2.8-3.4 m\n\n\nWiFi (lowband)\n2.4 GHz\n12.5 cm\n\n\nWiFi (highband)\n5 GHz\n6 cm\n\n\nBluetooth\n2.4 GHz\n12.5 cm\n\n\nCellular\n0.6–5 GHz\n6-50 cm\n\n\nGNSS\n1.575 GHz\n19 cm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see in Table 1 many of these antennas would not fit into the used device form factors, i.e., often we have to use electrically small antennas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 1: Wavelength Calculation\n\n\n\nLet’s calculate the wavelength for a Bluetooth signal at 2.4 GHz. Given:\n\nFrequency \\(f = 2.4\\) GHz \\(= 2.4 \\times 10^9\\) Hz\n\nSpeed of light \\(c = 3 \\times 10^8\\) m/s\n\nUsing the relationship \\(c = \\lambda f\\), we can solve for wavelength:\n\\[\\lambda = \\frac{c}{f} = \\frac{3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}}{2.4 \\times 10^9 \\text{ Hz}} = 0.125 \\text{ m} = 12.5 \\text{ cm}\\]\nThis means that a quarter-wavelength monopole antenna for 2.4 GHz Bluetooth would be approximately 3.1 cm long, which easily fits into most mobile devices.\n\n\nIn order to get a feeling for the attenuation experienced in wireless communication, we now calculate the following exemplary transmission. We will use the unit of dBm with is often used in RF design and is defined as\n\\[\nP|_\\text{dBm} = 10 \\cdot \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{P|_\\text{W}}{1\\,\\text{mW}} \\right)\n\\tag{2}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 2: Wireless Transmission\n\n\n\nWe use the following parameters:\n\nTransmit power \\(P_\\mathrm{T} = 1\\) W\nFrequency \\(f = 2.4\\) GHz\nCommunication distance \\(d = 10\\) km\nUsing \\(\\lambda/2\\) dipoles on both ends\n\nUsing Equation 1 we calculate\n\\[\nP_\\mathrm{R} = P_\\mathrm{T} \\cdot \\frac{0.13 \\lambda^2 \\cdot 0.13 \\lambda^2}{d^2 \\lambda^2} = P_\\mathrm{T} \\cdot 0.13^2 \\left( \\frac{\\lambda}{d} \\right)^2 =  2.64\\,\\text{pW} = -85.8\\,\\text{dBm}\n\\]\nWith the transmit power of 1 W = 30 dBm we have an attenuation of 116 dB! This is a very large number!\n\n\nAs dire as the situation of Note 2 already looks, this is not even all factors considered:\n\nThe given attenuation is for line-of-sight paths; often, the attenuation is significantly higher than this due to blockage by buildings, mountains, rain, or foliage.\nIn lack of a direct line-of-sight path, the EM wave is redirected by reflections, causing additional attenuation, and the potential destructive interference by multi-path reception.\n\nThe consequences of this are (among others):\n\nThe transmitter needs to generate enough transmit power to overcome the transmission loss; this has to be done often with high efficiency, as the transmit device is battery operated or limited by cooling.\nThe receiver has to be able to process weak signals, i.e., the noise level of the signal processing has to be very low.\nOften, the receive signal is very weak, while there are strong signals at other frequencies (i.e., other wireless transmitters are located close to the receiver). This means the receiver has to be able to process a weak signal while simultaneously tolerate large interfering signals (called blockers).\nSince the frequency spectrum is shared among many users and wireless applications, the transmit information has to be packed efficiently into a small bandwidth.\nVery often, wireless devices are battery-operated. This means transmit and receive functions have to be implemented using minimum power consumption.\n\nAs stated in the beginning, designing wireless systems is hard."
