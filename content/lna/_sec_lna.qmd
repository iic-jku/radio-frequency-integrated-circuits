# Low Noise Amplifiers {#sec-lna}

As shown in @sec-sensitivity, the sensitivity of a receiver is determined (besides the channel bandwidth) mainly by the noise figure of the receiver. The noise figure is in turn determined by the noise figure of the first active component in the receive chain, which is usually a low noise amplifier (LNA), as exemplified in @eq-friis. Hence, as shown in @fig-trx-fdd and @fig-trx-tdd, low noise amplifiers (LNAs) are the first active building block in a receiver after the antenna and some initial RF filtering.

{{< include /content/lna/_fig_lna_block.qmd >}}

The LNA as a building block is shown in @fig-lna-block. The main purpose of the LNA is to amplify the received signal with as little additional noise as possible. The LNA is usually designed for a specific frequency band, e.g., the 2.4 GHz ISM band or the 5 GHz WLAN band, and is typically designed for a specific impedance, e.g., 50 Ω, which is the standard impedance for RF systems; impedance matching is usually required at the input; the output impedance matching is only required if the output of the LNA goes off chip---if it is kept on chip impedance matching is often not required. The LNA is also designed to be sufficiently linear, i.e., to not introduce significant distortion to the amplified signal, however, compared to the noise requirements, linearity is often less critical.

Why is impedance matching at the input of the LNA so important?

- The antenna is usually designed for a specific impedance, e.g., 50 Ω, and if the LNA input is not matched to this impedance, a significant portion of the received signal will be reflected back to the antenna, resulting in a loss of signal power.
- Filters at the input of the LNA need to be terminated with the correct impedance to achieve the desired filter characteristics.
- Any transmission line in front of the LNA needs to be matched to avoid reflections and standing waves.

To quantify the "quality" of an impedance match, the reflection coefficient $\Gamma$ is often used, which is defined as [@Pozar_RF]:

$$
\Gamma = \frac{Z_{\mathrm{in}} - Z_0}{Z_{\mathrm{in}} + Z_0}
$$

where $Z_0$ is the characteristic impedance of the system (usually 50 Ω) and $Z_{\mathrm{in}}$ is the input impedance of the LNA. The reflection coefficient $\Gamma$ is a complex number with a magnitude between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates a perfect match and 1 indicates a complete mismatch. However, in practice, the more commonly used metric for impedance matching is the return loss (RL), which is defined as [@Pozar_RF]:

$$
\text{RL} = -20 \log_{10} |\Gamma| = 20 \log_{10} \left| \frac{Z_\mathrm{in} + Z_0}{Z_\mathrm{in} - Z_0} \right|.
$$

A higher return loss indicates a better impedance match.  A return loss of 10 dB indicates that 10% of the signal power is reflected back, while a return loss of 20 dB indicates that only 1% of the signal power is reflected back. In practice, a return loss of at least 10 dB is desired, with higher (positive!) values being better [@Bird.2009].

## Resistively Matched Common-Source LNA {#sec-lna-resistive-matching}

The key question is now how to design an LNA with low noise figure and an input impedance matched to 50 Ω? In order to appreciate this design challenge, we will first try a naive approach, using a common-source amplifier with resistive termination, as shown in @fig-lna-naive.

{{< include /content/lna/_fig_lna_naive.qmd >}}

If we assume the gate capacitance of $M_1$ negligible, we can achieve good input impedance matching by choosing $R_\mathrm{s} = R_\mathrm{p} = 50\,\Omega$. The voltage gain of this simple common-source LNA is given by $A_\mathrm{v} = -\gm R_\mathrm{D}$, neglecting capacitances and $\gds$ of $M_1$ (we assume that the load tank is tuned to the desired frequency with $\omega_0 = 1 / \sqrt{L C}$).

How can we calculate the noise figure of this simple LNA? We formulate

$$
F = \frac{\text{total noise at output}}{\text{noise at output due to source only}}.
$$ {#eq-lna-noise-factor}

We derive a small-signal equivalent circuit of @fig-lna-naive, which is shown in @fig-lna-naive-noise, to calculate the total noise at the output of the LNA.

{{< include /content/lna/_fig_lna_naive_noise.qmd >}}

Withe the help of @fig-lna-naive-noise, we can calculate the total output noise power spectral density as

$$
\overline{V_\mathrm{n,out,1}^2} = A_\mathrm{v}^2 \cdot 4 k T (R_\mathrm{s} \parallel R_\mathrm{p}) = (\gm R_\mathrm{D})^2 \cdot 4 k T (R_\mathrm{s} \parallel R_\mathrm{p})
$$

and

$$
\overline{I_\mathrm{n,out}^2} = 4 k T \gamma \gm + \frac{4 k T}{R_\mathrm{D}}
$$
$$
\overline{V_\mathrm{n,out,2}^2} = R_\mathrm{D}^2 \cdot \overline{I_\mathrm{n,out}^2} = 4 k T \gamma \gm R_\mathrm{D}^2 + 4 k T R_\mathrm{D}
$$

so that in total

$$
\overline{V_\mathrm{n,out}^2} = \overline{V_\mathrm{n,out,1}^2} + \overline{V_\mathrm{n,out,2}^2} = 4 k T \left[ (\gm R_\mathrm{D})^2 (R_\mathrm{s} \parallel R_\mathrm{p}) + \gamma \gm R_\mathrm{D}^2 + R_\mathrm{D} \right].
$$ {#eq-lna-naive-noise-total}

We now need to find the output noise coming from the source only. For this we can use the equivalent circuit in @fig-lna-naive-noise-input, to formulate the output noise due to the source only.

{{< include /content/lna/_fig_lna_naive_noise_input.qmd >}}

We find that

$$
\overline{V_\mathrm{n,out,s}^2} = A_\mathrm{v}^2 \cdot 4 k T R_\mathrm{s} \cdot \left(\frac{R_\mathrm{p}}{R_\mathrm{s} + R_\mathrm{p}}{} \right)^2.
$$ {#eq-lna-naive-noise-input}

Finally, we can use @eq-lna-naive-noise-total and @eq-lna-naive-noise-input with @eq-lna-noise-factor to calculate the noise figure of the simple resistively matched common-source LNA as

$$
F = \frac{\overline{V_\mathrm{n,out}^2}}{\overline{V_\mathrm{n,out,s}^2}} = 1 + \frac{R_\mathrm{s}}{R_\mathrm{p}} + \frac{\gamma R_\mathrm{s}}{\gm (R_\mathrm{s} \parallel R_\mathrm{p})^2} + \frac{R_\mathrm{s}}{\gm^2 (R_\mathrm{s} \parallel R_\mathrm{p})^2 R_\mathrm{D}}.
$$ {#eq-lna-naive-noise-factor}

::: {.callout-note}
## Common-source LNA with Resistive Matching 
As an exercise to calculate circuits with noise, re-confirm and derive yourself the result of @eq-lna-naive-noise-factor.
:::

How can we interpret @eq-lna-naive-noise-factor? We see that we can minimize the noise factor by making $\gm$ large. Then we have a noise factor of

$$
F = 1 + \frac{R_\mathrm{s}}{R_\mathrm{p}} = 2
$$

so we see that we are limited to a minimum noise figure of 3 dB, even if we spend the bias current to make $\gm$ very large. We can go below 3 dB noise figure only if we choose $R_\mathrm{p} > R_\mathrm{s}$, however, this means that the input is no longer matched to 50 Ω, which is usually not acceptable. Hence, this simple resistively matched common-source LNA is not a good choice for a low-noise amplifier, with one exception: For very wideband amplifiers, where a NF of larger then 3 dB is acceptable, this configuration might be a good choice.

We see that we are stuck at high noise figures if we realize the real part of the input impedance with a resistor. This leaves us with the question on how to realize a real part of the input impedance then? We will answer this question in the next section.

## Common-Gate LNA {#sec-lna-common-gate}

We remember from our [analog circuit design lecture](https://iic-jku.github.io/analog-circuit-design/analog_circuit_design.html) that the common-gate configuration has an input impedance of $1/\gm$, neglecting parasitic capacitances. Hence, if we choose $\gm = 1/50\,\Omega = 20\,\text{mS}$, we can achieve input matching to 50 Ω without using a resistor at the input. This is the key idea of the common-gate LNA, which is shown in @fig-lna-cg.

{{< include /content/lna/_fig_lna_cg.qmd >}}

By inspecting @fig-lna-cg and the practice from @sec-lna-resistive-matching, we can directly write down the output noise voltage as (with $1/\gm = R_\mathrm{s}$)

$$
\overline{V_\mathrm{n,out}^2} = k T \left[ (\gm R_\mathrm{D})^2 R_\mathrm{s} + \gamma \gm R_\mathrm{D}^2 + 4 R_\mathrm{D} \right] = k T \left( \frac{R_\mathrm{D}^2}{R_\mathrm{s}} + \gamma \frac{R_\mathrm{D}^2}{R_\mathrm{s}} + 4 R_\mathrm{D} \right).
$$ {#eq-lna-cg-noise-total} 

The output noise due to the source only is given by

$$
\overline{V_\mathrm{n,out,s}^2} = \frac{R_\mathrm{D}^2}{R_\mathrm{s}}.
$$ {#eq-lna-cg-noise-source}

Finally, we can use @eq-lna-cg-noise-total and @eq-lna-cg-noise-source with @eq-lna-noise-factor to calculate the noise figure of the common-gate LNA as

$$
F = 1 + \gamma + \frac{4 R_\mathrm{s}}{R_\mathrm{D}}  \xrightarrow{R_\mathrm{D} \gg R_\mathrm{s}} F = 1 + \gamma .
$$ {#eq-lna-cg-noise-factor}

With a classical long-channel $\gamma = 2/3$, we can achieve a minimum noise figure of 2.2 dB, which is already better than the resistively matched common-source LNA. However, with modern short-channel devices, $\gamma$ is often larger than 1, so that the minimum noise figure of the common-gate LNA is often larger than 3 dB [@Razavi_RFIC].

## Inductively-Degenerated Common-Source LNA {#sec-lna-inductive-degeneration}

As we have seen in @sec-lna-common-gate, using circuit techniques can realize a real part of an input impedance without the associated thermal noise of a resistor. We now try something different, in the hope that it will result in an even lower noise figure. We construct an LNA based on a common-source MOSFET amplifier, but we add an impedance $Z_\mathrm{deg}$ into the source line. This arrangement is shown in @fig-lna-inductive-degeneration.

{{< include /content/lna/_fig_lna_inductive_degeneration.qmd >}}

We now extract the small-signal equivalent circuit of @fig-lna-inductive-degeneration, which is shown in @fig-lna-inductive-degeneration-zin, to calculate the input impedance.

{{< include /content/lna/_fig_lna_inductive_degeneration_zin.qmd >}}

We find that

$$
v_\mathrm{x} = v_\mathrm{gs} + Z_\mathrm{deg} (i_\mathrm{x} + \gm v_\mathrm{gs}), \quad v_\mathrm{gs} = \frac{i_\mathrm{x}}{s C_\mathrm{gs}}
$$

so that we can write the input impedance as

$$
Z_\mathrm{in} = \frac{v_\mathrm{x}}{i_\mathrm{x}} = \frac{1}{s C_\mathrm{gs}} + Z_\mathrm{deg} + \frac{\gm Z_\mathrm{deg}}{s C_\mathrm{gs}}. 
$$ {#eq-lna-inductive-degeneration-zin}

The final term in @eq-lna-inductive-degeneration-zin is the interesting one: By choosing $Z_\mathrm{deg}$ to be inductive (which we can do by either use an on-chip or off-chip inductor), we can realize a real part of the input impedance. If we choose $Z_\mathrm{deg} = s L$, we find that

$$
Z_\mathrm{in} = \frac{1}{s C_\mathrm{gs}} + s L + \frac{\gm L}{C_\mathrm{gs}}.
$$

By proper choice of $L$ and $C_\mathrm{gs}$, we can achieve input matching to 50 Ω at the desired frequency $\omega_0$. We find that the real part of the input impedance is given by

$$
\Re \{ Z_\mathrm{in} \} = \frac{\gm L}{C_\mathrm{gs}}
$$

Without proof (refer to [@Razavi_RFIC] or [@Darabi_RFIC] for a derivation) we find for the noise factor of this input stage (with some simplification) as

$$
F = 1 + \frac{\gamma R_\mathrm{s} \omega_0^2 C_\mathrm{gs}^2}{\gm}.
$$ {#eq-lna-inductive-degeneration-noise-factor}

Finally we have an LNA input stage configuration which allows us to achieve a noise figure below 3 dB, even with $\gamma > 1$, by proper choice of $\gm$. Making $\gm$ large (by spending more bias current) results in (first order) arbitrarily low noise figure. The inductively-degenerated common-source LNA is a widely used LNA input stage configuration in modern RFICs. A somewhat detailed schematic is shown in @fig-lna-inductive-degeneration-detailed.

{{< include /content/lna/_fig_lna_inductive_degeneration_detailed.qmd >}}

The inductor $L_\mathrm{match}$ is used to match the input impedance to 50 Ω at the desired frequency, $L_\mathrm{deg}$ is used to realize the real part of the input impedance, $R_\mathrm{bias}$ is used to set the bias current of $M_1$, $M_2$ is a cascode transistor which increases the output impedance and thus the gain of the stage (plus it improves the reverse isolation), and $R_\mathrm{D}$, $L_\mathrm{D}$, and $C_\mathrm{D}$ form a load tank which provides high gain at the desired frequency. A dc block is used at the input so that the bias point of $M_1$ is not corrupted by the input signal source. The bias voltage $V_\mathrm{bias2}$ sets the operating point of the cascode transistor $M_2$.

What is missing in @fig-lna-inductive-degeneration-detailed is any form of frequency tuning of the load to the frequency of interest, and the support of different gain modes. Apart from these details this LNA circuit is a good starting point for a practical LNA design.

## Feedback LNA {#sec-lna-feedback}

One drawback of the inductively-degenerated common-source LNA is the usage of at least one inductor. If the inductor is placed on chip it has a comparatively large size, and if it is implemented in the package (via a bondwiew) or on the PCB it add to the bill-of-materials (BOM) cost.

If the CMOS technology is sufficiently fast, then a shunt feedback LNA, as shown in @fig-lna-shunt-fb, might be a good choice.

{{< include /content/lna/_fig_lna_shunt_fb.qmd >}}

Without proof, the input impedance of the shunt feedback LNA is given by

$$
Z_\mathrm{in} = \frac{Z_\mathrm{F} + Z_\mathrm{L}}{1 + \gm Z_\mathrm{L}}.
$$ {#eq-lna-shunt-fb-zin}

The noise factor of the shunt feedback LNA is given by

$$
F = 1 + \left| \frac{Z_\mathrm{F} + R_\mathrm{s}}{\gm Z_\mathrm{F} + 1} \right|^2 \cdot \frac{\gamma \gm + \Re \{ Y_\mathrm{L} \} }{\Re \{ Z_\mathrm{in} \}}
$$ {#eq-lna-shunt-fb-noise-factor}

As you can see from @eq-lna-shunt-fb-noise-factor, by making $\gm$ large (by spending more bias current) the noise figure can be made arbitrarily small! Depending on the choice of $Z_\mathrm{F}$ and $Z_\mathrm{L}$, the input impedance of this LNA can be changed in interesting ways.

By setting $Z_\mathrm{L} \rightarrow \infty$ (e.g., by biasing with a current source and high-impedance loading), we find that

$$
Z_\mathrm{in} = \frac{1}{\gm}
$$

which is independent of $Z_\mathrm{F}$ and is a well-known result for a common-source stage. The disadavntage of this configuration is the noise factor, which (given that $Z_\mathrm{F}$ is sufficiently large) trends to $F = 1 + \gamma$, which is the same as for the common-gate LNA.

A bit more interesting is the case when $\gm Z_\mathrm{L} = A_0$ and $Z_\mathrm{L} \gg Z_\mathrm{F}$, which results in

$$
Z_\mathrm{in} = \frac{Z_\mathrm{L}}{1 + A_0}
$$

which is the well-known result that the input impedance of an amplifier with feedback is reduced by the factor $1 + A_0$, where $A_0$ is the open-loop gain of the amplifier. The noise factor can be made small by making $\gm$ large, as we have already noted above.

A very interesting case can be achieved by choosing $Z_\mathrm{L} = 1 / s C_\mathrm{L}$ and $Z_\mathrm{F} = 1 / s C_\mathrm{F}$, which results in

$$
Y_\mathrm{in} = \frac{1}{Z_\mathrm{in}} = \frac{\gm C_\mathrm{F}}{C_\mathrm{L} + C_\mathrm{F}} + s \frac{C_\mathrm{L} C_\mathrm{F}}{C_\mathrm{L} + C_\mathrm{F}}
$$ {#eq-lna-shunt-fb-yin}

Looking at @eq-lna-shunt-fb-yin, we see that the input admittance has a **real part**! By proper choice of components, we can achieve an input impedance matched to 50 Ω at the desired frequency. The noise factor can again be made small by making $\gm$ large.

There is also an option, again by proper choice of $Z_\mathrm{F}$ and $Z_\mathrm{L}$, to achieve an inductive input impedance component, which can be used to resonate out the input capacitance of the LNA, similar to the inductively-degenerated common-source LNA. However, in contrast to the inductively-degenerated common-source LNA, no inductor is required in this case. This configuration is called a reactance-cancelling LNA.
