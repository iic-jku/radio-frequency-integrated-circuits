# Phase-Locked Loops {#sec-pll}

Thinking about oscillators, we face a dilemma:

- Good phase noise performance is reached with high $Q$ in the resonator (see @eq-leeson-equation).
- Oscillator tunability requires a tunable resonator, which usually results in a low-to-moderate $Q$.
- Oscillators have inherent frequency stability issues due to temperature variations, device aging, and supply voltage fluctuations.

## Basic PLL Architecture {#sec-basic-pll-architecture}

We solve this dilemma by using a **phase-locked loop (PLL)** to stabilize and control the frequency of a tunable oscillator, mostly in the form of a VCO. A PLL is a feedback control system that locks the phase of the VCO output to the phase of a reference signal, typically generated by a crystal oscillator with excellent frequency stability. The block diagram of a basic PLL is shown in @fig-pll-block-diagram.

{{< include /content/pll/_fig_pll_block_diagram.qmd >}}

A reference frequency (often coming from a high-$Q$ crystal oscillator) is compared to the phase of a VCO output signal in a phase detector (PD). The phase error is low-pass filtered and used to tune the VCO frequency. By continuously adjusting the VCO based on the phase difference, the PLL ensures that the VCO output remains synchronized with the reference signal, effectively combining the stability of the reference with the tunability of the VCO. When the output signal of the VCO is fed back to the phase detector through a frequency divider (with division ratio $N$), the PLL can generate output frequencies that are integer multiples of the reference frequency, given by $f_\mathrm{out} = N \cdot f_\mathrm{ref}$.

The PD compares the phase of the reference signal with the phase of the VCO output signal. It works in the time domain and produces an output voltage proportional to the arrival time difference (phase difference) between the two input signals. This output voltage, known as the phase error signal, indicates whether the VCO is leading or lagging the reference signal in phase expressed as

$$
\Delta \varphi = 2 \pi \frac{\Delta t}{T_\mathrm{ref}}
$$

and

$$
V_\mathrm{error} = K_\mathrm{PD} \cdot \Delta \varphi
$$

where $\Delta \varphi$ is the phase difference (cause by the arrival time difference) in rad, $K_\mathrm{PD}$ is the phase detector gain in V/rad, $\Delta t$ is the time difference between the two signals, and $T_\mathrm{ref}$ is the period of the reference signal.

An important consideration of the PD is its linear operating range. The PD can only provide a linear output voltage for small phase differences, typically within ±180° (±π rad). If the phase difference exceeds this range, the PD characteristic "wraps around," leading to ambiguity in the phase error signal. This can cause the PLL to lose lock or behave unpredictably. Therefore, the PLL design must ensure that the phase difference remains within the linear range of the PD during normal operation, which is especially troublesome if the output frequency $f_\mathrm{out}$ is not yet close enough to its final steady-state value. Note that a simple PD can be implemented by using an XOR gate for digital signals or a mixer for analog signals.

{{< include /content/pll/_fig_pd_xor_diagram.qmd >}}

We can see in @fig-pd-xor-diagram that the output of the XOR PD is high when the two input signals differ and low when they are the same. The output duty cycle is proportional to the phase difference between the two input signals. Note that this PD has no notion of frequency, only phase! Still, it can be used to lock the frequency of the VCO to the reference frequency, as a constant phase difference implies equal frequencies; however, this only works if the initial frequency difference is small enough. Also, this XOR-based PD does not evaluate the edges of the input signals, only their logic states. Therefore, it is crucial that both input signals are square waves with a 50% duty cycle to ensure proper operation of the PD.

As the output signal of the PD contains high-frequency components (at least at twice the reference frequency), a low-pass filter (LPF) is used to smooth the phase error signal before it is applied to the VCO tuning input. The LPF also determines the dynamic response of the PLL, affecting its stability and transient behavior. A well-designed LPF ensures that the PLL can quickly respond to changes in the reference signal or disturbances while maintaining stability and minimizing overshoot or oscillations in the output frequency. Often, the LPF has voltage-mode inputs and outputs to connect to the PD and VCO, respectively.

Using a digital divider in the feedback path to only pass every $N$-th cycle of the VCO output to the PD allows the PLL to generate output frequencies that are integer multiples of the reference frequency. This is particularly useful in applications such as frequency synthesis, where a wide range of frequencies is required from a single stable reference source. By adjusting the division ratio $N \in \mathbb{N}$, the PLL can produce various output frequencies while maintaining phase lock with the reference signal. However, note that the frequency resolution of the output frequencies $\Delta f_\mathrm{out}$ is limited to integer multiples of the reference frequency!

Putting everything together into an $s$-domain block diagram, the PLL can be modeled as shown in @fig-pll-block-diagram-s-domain.

{{< include /content/pll/_fig_pll_block_diagram_s_domain.qmd >}}

For the loop filter transfer function $H(s)$ we assume a simple first-order low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of $\omega_\mathrm{LP} = 1 / T_\mathrm{LP}$ given by

$$
H_\mathrm{LP}(s) = \frac{1}{1 + s T_\mathrm{LP}}.
$$

## Why Regulate Phase Instead of Frequency?
Before we proceed, it is worth discussing why PLLs regulate the phase of the VCO output rather than its frequency directly. The reason lies in the relationship between phase and frequency: Frequency is the time derivative of phase. By controlling the phase, the PLL inherently controls the frequency as well. Additionally, even if the phase regulation has a steady state phase error $\varphi_\mathrm{err}$, the frequency error in steady state is **zero**, as can be appreciated when inspecting

$$
\omega_\mathrm{out}(t) = \frac{d \varphi_\mathrm{out}(t)}{dt}  = \frac{d}{dt} \left[ N \cdot \varphi_\mathrm{ref}(t) + \varphi_\mathrm{err} \right] = N \cdot \frac{d \varphi_\mathrm{ref}(t)}{dt} = N \cdot \omega_\mathrm{ref}(t).
$$

:::

We now derive the closed-loop transfer function of the PLL from reference phase $\varphi_\mathrm{ref}(s)$ to output phase $\varphi_\mathrm{out}(s)$. First, we note that

$$
V_\mathrm{PD}(s) = K_\mathrm{PD} \left[ \varphi_\mathrm{ref}(s) - \frac{\varphi_\mathrm{out}(s)}{N} \right]
$$

and

$$
\varphi_\mathrm{out}(s) = \frac{K_\mathrm{VCO}}{s} \cdot H_\mathrm{LP}(s) \cdot V_\mathrm{PD}(s) = \frac{K_\mathrm{VCO}}{s} \cdot \frac{1}{1 + s T_\mathrm{LP}} \cdot K_\mathrm{PD} \left[ \varphi_\mathrm{ref}(s) - \frac{\varphi_\mathrm{out}(s)}{N} \right].
$$

Not that this equation as one integrator $1/s$ (which we can also see in @fig-pll-block-diagram-s-domain). We call PLLs with one integrator in the loop a **Type-I PLL**. We can now rearrange to find the closed-loop transfer function $H(s)$ as

$$
H(s) = \frac{\varphi_\mathrm{out}(s)}{\varphi_\mathrm{ref}(s)} = N \cdot \frac{K_\mathrm{VCO} \cdot K_\mathrm{PD} \cdot \omega_\mathrm{LP} / N}{s^2 + s \cdot \omega_\mathrm{LP} + K_\mathrm{VCO} \cdot K_\mathrm{PD} \cdot \omega_\mathrm{LP} / N}.
$$ {#eq-pll-transfer-function}

We can use all techniques known from control theory to analyze the stability and dynamic response of the PLL based on @eq-pll-transfer-function, however, we have to keep the following in mind:

- $H(s)$ is a small-signal model of the PLL around its locked operating point, only valid for small perturbations. Large-signal behavior, such as acquisition and lock range, are not captured by this model.
- A PLL is a sampled system, working at instances of $T_\mathrm{ref}$. $H(s)$ is a continuous-time approximation, which is valid only if the loop bandwidth is much smaller (typically $1/10$) than the reference frequency $f_\mathrm{ref}$. If this approximation is not valid, a discrete-time model of the PLL must be used deriving the $z$-domain transfer function $H(z)$.

If we compare the canonical form of a second-order system given by

$$
H(s) = K \cdot \frac{\omega_\mathrm{n}^2}{s^2 + s \cdot 2 \zeta \omega_\mathrm{n} + \omega_\mathrm{n}^2},
$$

with @eq-pll-transfer-function, we can identify the natural frequency $\omega_n$ and the damping factor $\zeta$ of the PLL as

$$
\omega_\mathrm{n} = \sqrt{\frac{K_\mathrm{VCO} \cdot K_\mathrm{PD} \cdot \omega_\mathrm{LP}}{N}}
$$

and

$$
\zeta = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{\omega_\mathrm{LP} \cdot N}{K_\mathrm{VCO} \cdot K_\mathrm{PD}}}.
$$

This allows us to use standard control theory results to design the PLL parameters $K_\mathrm{PD}$, $K_\mathrm{VCO}$, $\omega_\mathrm{LP}$, and $N$ to achieve the desired dynamic response and stability margins. Note that $\omega_\mathrm{n}$ and $\zeta$ are not independent, as they both depend on the same set of PLL parameters! This seriously limits the design of the loop dynamics, and means that we need a more complex loop filter $H_\mathrm{LP}(s)$ to achieve more freedom in selecting $\omega_\mathrm{n}$ and $\zeta$ independently. Often, we want to choose $\zeta = 1/\sqrt{2} \approx 0.707$ to achieve a Butterworth response for a good step response without overshoot.

The poles of a second-order system are given by

$$
p_{1,2} = -\omega_\mathrm{n} \left( \zeta \pm \sqrt{\zeta^2 - 1} \right)
$$

with $\zeta = 1/\sqrt{2}$ resulting in complex conjugate poles at

$$
p_{1,2} = -\frac{\omega_\mathrm{n}}{\sqrt{2}} \pm j \frac{\omega_\mathrm{n}}{\sqrt{2}}.
$$

To summarize: We can make a simple PLL using an XOR for a PD, use a first-order LPF, plus a feedback divider to get frequency multiplication of $f_\mathrm{out} = N \cdot f_\mathrm{ref}$. However, the control over the loop dynamics is very limited, and the locking procedure of the PLL is tricky, as the PD has a limited linear range of ±180°, requiring that the VCO frequency at the start of the locking procedure is already close enough to the desired output frequency. In addition, $N$ is an integer, limiting the frequency resolution of the output frequencies to integer multiples of the reference frequency.

The question is how to improve the PLL design to overcome these limitations? We will explore advanced PLL architectures and techniques in the following section.

## Charge-Pump PLL {#sec-charge-pump-pll}

The fundamental limitations of the simple PLL architecture presented in @sec-basic-pll-architecture can be addressed by using a more sophisticated phase detector known as a **charge pump (CP)** in combination with a **phase-frequency detector (PFD)**. This combination allows for better control over the loop dynamics and improved locking behavior.

In order to drive the CP, we envision a PFD with two digital outputs: An "up" signal that indicates when the VCO phase lags behind the reference phase, and a "down" signal that indicates when the VCO phase leads the reference phase. The PFD compares both the phase and frequency of the reference and feedback signals, providing a more robust locking mechanism. The typical implementation of a PFD is shown in @fig-pfd-implementation.

{{< include /content/pll/_fig_pfd_implementation.qmd >}}

The PFD operates as follows:

- If the reference signal leads the feedback signal (its rising edge arrives first), the "UP" output is activated, causing the CP to source current into the integration capacitor, *increasing* the VCO tuning voltage and thus the VCO frequency.
- If the feedback signal leads the reference signal (its rising edge arrives first), the "DOWN" output is activated, causing the CP to sink current from the integration capacitor, *decreasing* the VCO tuning voltage and thus the VCO frequency.
- If both signals are aligned in phase and frequency, both are only activated for a short time (the gate delays of the DFF and the AND), and the CP does not source or sink current; the integration capacitor in the loop filter holds its voltage, maintaining the VCO frequency.
- The rising edge that arrives last resets both outputs, ensuring that the CP only sources or sinks current for a duration proportional to the phase difference between the two signals.

In the following, we will look at four different cases of PFD operation to illustrate its behavior.

1. *Reference leads feedback*: The "UP" output is activated, and the CP sources current to the loop filter, increasing the VCO frequency.

{{< include /content/pll/_fig_pfd_diagram1.qmd >}}

2. *Feedback leads reference*: The "DOWN" output is activated, and the CP sinks current from the loop filter, decreasing the VCO frequency.

{{< include /content/pll/_fig_pfd_diagram2.qmd >}}

3. *Both signals aligned*: Both outputs are briefly activated, but the CP does not source or sink current, maintaining the VCO frequency.

{{< include /content/pll/_fig_pfd_diagram3.qmd >}}

4. *Large frequency difference*: The PFD continues to source or sink current until the phases align, allowing the PLL to acquire lock even with large initial frequency differences.

{{< include /content/pll/_fig_pfd_diagram4.qmd >}}

Let us now investigate the circuit of the CP. The UP and DOWN signals from the PFD control two current sources/sinks connected to the loop filter capacitor, as shown in @fig-cp-implementation.

{{< include /content/pll/_fig_cp_circuit.qmd >}}

When the UP signal is high, the CP *sources* a constant current $I_\mathrm{CP}$ into the loop filter capacitor $C_\mathrm{int}$, increasing its voltage linearly over time according to the phase error. Conversely, when the DOWN signal is high, the CP *sinks* a constant current $I_\mathrm{CP}$ from the capacitor, decreasing its voltage linearly.

Note that the top and bottom current sources must be well matched to ensure symmetric operation of the CP and should have a wide operating range. The output impedance of the CP is ideally very high so that the charge pump current does not depend on the voltage across the loop filter capacitor. Further, the switches introduce charge injection and clock feedthrough, which can cause unwanted ripples on the loop filter voltage, leading to spurious signals in the PLL output. Careful design of the switches and layout techniques are necessary to minimize these effects.

The voltage change on the capacitor can be expressed as

$$
\Delta V_\mathrm{LF} = \frac{1}{C_\mathrm{LF}} \int_0^{t_\mathrm{on}} I_\mathrm{int} \cdot dt
$$ {#eq-cp-voltage-change}

where $t_\mathrm{on}$ is the duration for which the UP or DOWN signal is active, proportional to the phase difference between the reference and feedback signals.

Taking the Laplace transform of @eq-cp-voltage-change, we find the transfer function of the CP from the UP/DOWN control signals to the loop filter voltage as

$$
H_\mathrm{CP}(s) = \frac{I_\mathrm{CP}}{2 \pi} \left( \frac{1}{s C_\mathrm{int}} + R_\mathrm{int} \right)
$$ {#eq-cp-transfer-function}

where we have added a resistor $R_\mathrm{int}$ in series with the capacitor $C_\mathrm{int}$ to introduce a zero in the loop filter transfer function,

clearly showing the zero introduced by the resistor $R_\mathrm{int}$ in series to the capacitor $C_\mathrm{int}$. The need of this zero will become apparent when we analyze the PLL loop dynamics next.

The resulting PLL using a PFD-CP combination is shown in @fig-pll-pfd-cp.

{{< include /content/pll/_fig_pfd_cp_pll.qmd >}}

Neglecting $R_\mathrm{lp}$ and $C_\mathrm{lp}$ for now, we can derive the closed-loop transfer function of the PLL from reference phase $\varphi_\mathrm{ref}(s)$ to output phase $\varphi_\mathrm{out}(s)$ as

$$
H(s) = \frac{\varphi_\mathrm{out}(s)}{\varphi_\mathrm{ref}(s)} = N \cdot \frac{\frac{I_\mathrm{CP} K_\mathrm{VCO}}{2 \pi C_\mathrm{int} N} (1 + s C_\mathrm{int} R_\mathrm{int})}{s^2 + s \frac{I_\mathrm{CP} K_\mathrm{VCO} R_\mathrm{int}}{2 \pi N} + \frac{I_\mathrm{CP} K_\mathrm{VCO}}{2 \pi C_\mathrm{int} N}} = N \cdot \frac{s \cdot 2 \zeta \omega_\mathrm{n} + \omega_\mathrm{n}^2}{s^2 + s \cdot 2 \zeta \omega_\mathrm{n} + \omega_\mathrm{n}^2}
$$ {#eq-cp-pll-transfer-function}

with

$$
\omega_\mathrm{n} = \sqrt{\frac{I_\mathrm{CP} K_\mathrm{VCO}}{2 \pi C_\mathrm{int} N}}
$$ {#eq-cp-pll-natural-frequency}

and

$$
\zeta = \frac{R_\mathrm{int}}{2} \sqrt{\frac{I_\mathrm{CP} K_\mathrm{VCO} C_\mathrm{int}}{2 \pi N}}.
$$ {#eq-cp-pll-damping-factor}

Looking at @eq-cp-pll-natural-frequency and @eq-cp-pll-damping-factor, we can see that we now have one *independent* parameter ($R_\mathrm{int}$) to set the natural frequency $\omega_\mathrm{n}$ and the damping factor $\zeta$ of the PLL independently. This allows us to design the loop dynamics more flexibly to achieve the desired performance.

With @eq-cp-pll-damping-factor, we can now appreciate the need for the resistor $R_\mathrm{int}$ in series with the capacitor $C_\mathrm{int}$ in the loop filter. Without this resistor, the damping factor $\zeta$ would be zero, leading to an undamped system with oscillatory behavior and poor transient response. The resistor introduces a zero in the loop filter transfer function, providing the necessary damping to stabilize the PLL and improve its dynamic response.

Looking at @fig-pll-pfd-cp and @eq-cp-transfer-function, we can also see that the PFD-CP introduces another integrator in the loop. This integrator, together with the integrator from the VCO, makes the PLL a **Type-II PLL**. A Type-II PLL can achieve zero steady-state phase error for step changes in the reference phase and zero steady-state frequency error for ramp changes in the reference frequency.

In conclusion:

- The PLL regulates the phase of a VCO to match the phase of a reference signal, using feedback control. Even with a steady-state phase error, the frequency error is zero (Type-I PLL). In a Type-II PLL, both phase and frequency errors are zero in steady state.
- The lowpass behavior of the loop filter determines the dynamic response and stability of the PLL.
- Further, the PLL transfer function from reference phase to output phase has the form of a lowpass, which passes the reference oscillator phase noise to the output inside the passband. The phase noise of the VCO is suppressed inside the loop bandwidth, as the PLL corrects for phase deviations.
- Outside the PLL loop bandwidth, the VCO phase noise dominates, as the PLL cannot correct for phase deviations fast enough.

This phase noise shaping behavior is illustrated in @fig-pll-phase-noise, which shows how the reference and VCO phase noise contributions combine to form the total PLL output phase noise.

{{< include /content/pll/_fig_pll_phase_noise.qmd >}}

Note that inside the PLL loop bandwidth the reference phase noise is multiplied by the division ratio $N$ in power, i.e., $20 \log_{10}(N)$ in dB, as the PLL output frequency is $N$ times the reference frequency. In @fig-pll-phase-noise, $N = 100$ and a reference phase noise of -140 dBc/Hz is used. Large values of $N$ can significantly increase the reference phase noise contribution at the PLL output, which is why low phase noise references are essential for high-performance PLLs.

## All-Digital PLL {#sec-all-digital-pll}
